I hope you already have python installed on your system
open the CMD (command prompt) and change your current directory to the desktop then type the below line
python maze.py maze1.txt
if everthing went good, this program will run and the one image file will also save on the desktop
if you find any issue regarding no moudle name PIL found then please get installed this module.
if still you are not able to install PIL module the please comment the last line in the code
m.output_image("maze.png", show_explored=True) (comment this line and run the code it will work)

if you want to create your own source and destination in the maze1.txt file you can modify it and create your own also.
